Generator test.

IPv6Gene Expected flow: should allow generate this. At the start, new RIR prefix with length 18 will be generated. After
that all prefixes will be generated by trie traversal process.

start distribution is present in sample_dataset4 folder in datasets and contains 2 prefixes: 1 - /48 and 1 - /32

number of prefixes after generating process is 8
